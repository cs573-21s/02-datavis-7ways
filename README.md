# R + ggplot2 + R Markdown

R is a language primarily focused on statistical computing.
ggplot2 is a popular library for charting in R.
R Markdown is a document format that compiles to HTML or PDF and allows you to include the output of R code directly in the document.

To visualized the cars dataset, I made use of ggplot2's `geom_point()` layer, with aesthetics functions for the color and size.

While it takes time to find the correct documentation, these functions made the effort creating this chart minimal.

To meet the requirement for color by manufacturer and size by weight I seperated the data in to series. I split the weight evenly in 500 lb increments so I needed 7 series just for Ford for example. I could not figure out how to get the tick marks to start somewhere other than the start of the range. So on the x-axis they start at 8 instead of 10.
