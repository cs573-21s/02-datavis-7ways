Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 7 Ways

# Flourish
Flourish is a web-based visualization tool which announces itself can make beautiful and easy visualization and storytelling. Actually, it is indeed very easy to create a visualization by using Flourish. In its website, I only need to upload a csv file and set the attributes I want to display, then vis was created.

In Flourish, every step to create a vis can be completed in the visual interface. The user does not need to code anymore. I think this way is very convenient for people who are not familiar with coding. And it is website based, so, people can create vis anywhere if they have internet and screen-device which can be connected to internet. In addition, when vis is done on its website, a link can be created to share with others, and this link can be used to easily nest this vis in my website page.

However, I think it also have some restriction for professional user, because its templates are set in advance. If people canâ€™t find template which is matched to vis they want create, Flourish will be not good working.
