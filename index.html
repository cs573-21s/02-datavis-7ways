        <h1>Comparison of Visualization Tools</h1>
        <p>In the readme report I summarized my experiences, likes, and dislikes for each visualization tool. However, I
            wanted to provide some direct comparisons in more tangible categories. Therefore, I ranked all of the tools
            in 5 distinct categories: learnability, file size, customization, hackiness, and visual appeal. Although this is mostly subjective, it's based on my experience making the
            scatter plot in each tool and helps to compare the different tools.</p>
        <h2 id="graphTitle">Learnability</h2>
        <p id="description">This shows the ranking of the tools based on a combination of how easy they were to learn
            and the quality of their documentation. This is the most important metric in my opinion.</p>

        <select id="optionList">
            <option value="learnability">Learnability</option>

        <h4>Tabular View of Results</h4>
        <p>I created a simple score system to quantify these rankings. It uses the following format:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1st place: 7 points</li>
            <li>2nd place: 6 points</li>
            <li>3rd place: 5 points</li>
            <li>4th place: 4 points</li>
            <li>5th place: 3 points</li>
            <li>6th place: 2 points</li>
            <li>7th place: 1 point</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>Based on these results I would say R + ggplot2 is the best visualization tool for creating a bubble chart.
            With Vega-Lite as a close second place. This suprises me a little because R was the tool I was most afraid
            to use going in. But considering the graph we are trying to model was also build in R, maybe this makes
            sense.</p>
        <p>There is some bias in this ranking. All of the file sizes are small and that may not be a big factor,
            although
            writing all of the R code in a few lines is cool. Tableau was incredibly easy to learn, so despite these
            results, I may advise people inexperienced with coding to use Tableau in the future. Learnability in my
            opinion is the most valuable of these usability metrics I measured, and so I do have to recommend Tableau as
            well.</p>
