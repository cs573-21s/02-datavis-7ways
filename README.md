Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 7 Ways  
===

# Flourish
Flourish is a web-based visualization tool which announces itself can make beautiful and easy visualization and storytelling. Actually, it is indeed very easy to create a visualization by using Flourish. In its website, I only need to upload a csv file and set the properties I want to display, then vis was created.

In Flourish, every step to create a vis can be completed in the visual interface. The user does not need to code anymore. I think this way is very convenient for people who are not familiar with coding. And it is website based, so, people can create vis anywhere if they have internet and screen-device which can be connected to internet. In addition, when vis is done on its website, a link can be created to share with others, and this link can be used to easily nest this vis in my website page.

However, I think it also have some restriction for professional user, because its templates are set in advance. If people can’t find template which is matched to vis they want create, Flourish will be not good working.

# Tableau
Tableau is a data analysis platform which you must buy the software and download on computer. The software is so easy to get started that it helps people focus on data without spending too much time learning how to use it. 

Similar with Flourish, every step to create a vis can be done in the GUI, without people having any code experience. To create a vis, I only need to upload a csv file and set the properties I want to display.

Different with Flourish, it is as simple as dragging and dropping. In addition, you don’t need to choose a template in advance. The software will automatically create the vis in an acceptable way. Thus, users can focus on the data and dig out the information underlie the data. Moreover, Tableau can automatically create legends and some interactions, giving people a better perception. 

However, I found it is difficult to set specific values for certain properties in Tableau. For example, I want to set specific sizes for the smallest circle and the largest circle but it is difficult. I found that Tableau is easy to set the trend of size changes or change the overall size.
