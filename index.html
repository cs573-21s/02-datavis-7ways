        <h1>Comparison of Visualization Tools</h1>
        <p>In the readme report I summarized my experiences, likes, and dislikes for each visualization tool. However, I
            wanted to provide some direct comparisons in more direct ways. Therefore, I ranked all of the tools
            in 5 distinct categories: learnability, file size, customization, hackiness, and visual appeal. Although
            this is mostly subjective, it's based on my experience making these
            scatter plots and helps to compare the different tools.</p>
        <h2 id="graphTitle">Learnability</h2>
        <p id="description">This shows the ranking of the tools based on a combination of how easy they were to learn
            and the quality of their documentation. This is the most important metric in my opinion.</p>
        <div id="svgzone"></div>

        <select id="optionList">
            <option value="learnability">Learnability</option>

        <h4>Tabular View of Results</h4>
        <p>I created a simple score system to quantify these rankings. It uses the following format:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1st place: 7 points</li>
            <li>2nd place: 6 points</li>
            <li>3rd place: 5 points</li>
            <li>4th place: 4 points</li>
            <li>5th place: 3 points</li>
            <li>6th place: 2 points</li>
            <li>7th place: 1 point</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>Based on these results I would say R + ggplot2 is the best visualization tool for creating a bubble chart.
            With Vega-Lite as a close second place. This suprises me a little because R was the tool I was most afraid
            to use going in. But considering the graph we are trying to model was also build in R, maybe this makes
            sense. I definitely enjoyed learning R and found it very easy to use.</p>
        <p>There is some bias in this ranking. All of the file sizes are small and that may not be a big factor,
            although
            writing all of the R code in a few lines is cool. Additionally, learnability, in my opinion, is the most
            valuable the metrics I measured. Tableau was incredibly easy to learn, so despite these
            results, I may advise people inexperienced with coding to use Tableau in the future. It's just very user
            friendly.</p>
