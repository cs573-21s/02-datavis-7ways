Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 7 Ways

# R + ggplot2 + R Markdown

I used RStudio and a tutorial video to replicate the chart for the assignment and used this as the starting point to consistently replicate in 6 other tools. I made changes to the color of the marks and background.

While it takes time to find the correct documentation, these functions made the effort creating this chart minimal.

(And so on...)

# Excel

To meet the requirement for color by manufacturer and size by weight I seperated the data in to series. I split the weight evenly in 500 lb increments so I needed 7 series just for Ford for example. I could not figure out how to get the tick marks to start somewhere other than the start of the range. So on the x-axis they start at 8 instead of 10.

Creating the chart in Excel was pretty easy though it did require some manipulation of the data to get the desired seperation of color and size of the marks.

### Design Achievements
- **Color**: I played around with the colors of the marks and background a good amount to come up with a color scheme that I found visually appealing and where the marks stood out from each other and the background while meeting the requirements of 50% opacity. 
- **Consistency**:
