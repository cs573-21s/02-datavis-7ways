These features should be preserved as much as possible in your replication:

Data positioning: it should be a downward-trending scatterplot as shown. Weight should be on the x-axis and MPG on the y-axis.
Scales: Note the scales do not start at 0.
Axis ticks and labels: both axes are labeled and there are tick marks at 10, 20, 30, etcetera.
Color mapping to Manufacturer.
Size mapping to Weight.
Opacity of circles set to 0.5 or 50%.

Other features are not required. This includes:

The background grid.
The legends.
