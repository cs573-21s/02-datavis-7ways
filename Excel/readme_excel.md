The first step on my journey into scatter plot visualization was excel. In the past, whenever I explore a new csv file this is usually my first step because I can quickly throw together a scatterplot or other visualization with minimal effort. So I was very surprised to discover this was the hardest tool to use for this assignment. 

According to Wikipedia, Microsoft Excel is the industry standard spreatsheet application. It has come a long way since its original release in 1987 and now provides a lot of features for exploring data. Some of these features include basic visualization tools. Although it does support the use of Visual Basic (VBA) for writing coded macros, I limited myself to only using standard Excel features for this project.

While it's great for simple visualizations, Excel does not do a great job at making complex graphs. It is strict in its requirement for the number of series affecting the data points. With a bubble chart it expects three values: x, y, and bubble size. To add a fourth value of color a lot of hacky maneuvers need to be taken [1,2]. For each different color/manufacturer type, I had to create a separate series and put the weight (x values) in that and #N/A values in the column for when it was not of that type. You can see a subset of this change in the data below. When a car was a Ford it's weight would go in the ford column and a #N/A value would go in the others. Then each of these would be plotted on the graph as different colors. The weight column itself stayed because it was used for bubble size. The only nice part of this hack is it allowed the color legend to be auto generated.

Another major draw back was there appears to be no built in way to add a weight legend to the Excel graph. Excel does support VBA scripts but I wanted to try to do everything purely with Excel. So for this legend I had to add a textbox and manually draw the weight cirles. It's tedious and not automated, but it doesn't look that bad.

The last challenge with Excel, is that I could not get the axis tick mark labels to appear where I wanted, they always had to start from the origin. Additionally, this causes one of the bubbles to get cut off by the bottom X axis.

Excel took me a very long time to complete compared to all of the others. It's very limited in what it allows and doesn't allow much customization beyond their given features. I would not recommend Excel for fancy visualizations, but I would say it's still a solid choice for very simple, quick graphs like basic bar charts or 2 feature scatter plots.

## How to Run
Load the .xlsx file in Excel, I created this file in the latest verion of Excel, the Microsoft Office 365 version. Once you load it you will see the graph.
